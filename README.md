##Usethe App [here](https://fri-end.herokuapp.com/)

**Developer**: Ninti Chance

It's weird how the things that we once cherished could haunt us upon later review. A necklace an ex gave you. A book that your late grandmother imparted to you. Or even a collection of VHS's that remind you of your childhood. Sometimes holding onto these things ameliorate the end and sometimes, it just exasperates you. Cartharsis is important. It's release. It's letting go. This app lets you tell the story of the things you're hoarding, while also letting you healthily distance yourself from them. Don't hoard in your closet, document it online. Who knows, maybe someone will relate to your story.

##The Planning Stages

The most important thing that I learned during this project is to cnfidently find the story that you want to tell will your app and let your process support as you progress. I think it is integral for every step of the process, from the planning stages to deployment to find and focus on a clear through-line. In future projects, conceptually, I will spend more time asking, "what is the overall goal" and only use small goals to facilitate the larger picture.
